Eye of Agamotto

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tleen/eye-of-agamotto.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tleen/eye-of-agamotto)

** Very early in dev, can't do much yet! **

Node module, caching passthrough to the [Marvel API](http://developer.marvel.com/).

For now, this is just a way to familiarize myself with the API. Caching is needed as you are only allowed 1000(!) calls a day. Throttling is also enabled to keep from hitting frequency limits.

Of course, the data is provided by [Marvel](http://marvel.com).
